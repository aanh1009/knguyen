                  <p>
                    <p class="t">Character, possibilities : </p>These people will have to make choices very often and it is necessary to make the right decisions in the face of emerging opportunities. Romantic relationship, family and home are the foundations for success. They like helping others. They need a partner who meets their expectations. They long for the harmonisation of their relationships. They are usually successful in their love life and marriage. However, it is necessary to find willingness to make compromises. They often have a talent for business and a sense for aesthetics and art. They should regularly take good care of their health. They emphasise the material side of life. It is very important to clarify what is good and what is bad, and understand that the purpose of challenges is to strengthen and check personÂ´s determination. Recognition and love, that improve self-confidence are very important.</p>
                  <p class="x">
                    Weaknesses, what should be learned: Beware of hesitation, restlessness and intolerance. Beware of excessive desire for perfection and irritability.

                    <p class="t">Sun in Libra <img src="https://www.astro-seek.com/seek-images/seek-icons/horoskop-vahy.gif"/></p>Perhaps to make their sign happy, people born under the sign of Libra are usually prudent, balanced and harmonious. In any case, they think before they do something. It is possible to find hot-headed individuals among Libras, but they are very rare exceptions. These people are sincere, honest and decent. They find it very hard to tolerate noisy, rude or abusive behaviour and conduct. People born under this sign have strong aesthetic sense and artistic talent; it does not matter what artistic activity they choose to do, they will be great at it. If they do not become active artists, then their good taste will be seen in everything they do. They are skilful, diligent, intelligent and adventurous.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <p class="z">Sun in the 7th house</p>The Sun in the seventh house creates people who are well-known to the public. The life of these people is under the influence of their family or business partners. These connections give them energy and orientation, because they have a lack of initiative and their actions are based on the reactions of others. These individuals can deal with people and they have a talent for dealing with the public. They may find employment in jobs such as sales and advertising. The power and influence of these people depends on their relationships with others. These people will have to help others and this will help them to climb up the career ladder. They have strongly developed sense of balance and they have the ability to be the leaders.

                    <p class="t">Moon in Scorpio <img src="https://www.astro-seek.com/seek-images/seek-icons/horoskop-stir.gif"/></p>Moon in Scorpio creates the need to delve into your feelings as deep as possible and this brings great vulnerability. You never forget anything that was done to you. It's hard to force you to do anything.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <p class="z">Moon in the 8th house</p>The Moon in the eighth house creates people who find the feeling of security very important. These people are extremely thrifty. They have a strong sense of responsibility towards others and they are likely to engage in a movement that will be for the general good of humanity. They are aware of social trends and aspirations. They may have the ability to get money out of other people in an unfair way. This position often indicates inheritance.

                      <p class="t">Mercury in Libra <img src="https://www.astro-seek.com/seek-images/seek-icons/horoskop-vahy.gif"/></p>People with Mercury in Libra love the balance between theory and practice. They often make funny, but diplomatic remarks about people and situations. Their original way of thinking is reflected in their writing. With a bit of exaggeration it can be said that while people with Mercury in the Gemini prefer writing reports, people with Mercury in Libra go straight into writing a novel because they need to develop their ideas instead of putting some information on the paper. It can also be said that Mercury feels the best in air signs, but it can be a bit shallow in them - these people do not like to study things into the greatest detail. Air, the ruling element, which is definitely not a solid substance, is responsible for this, probably only one, shortcoming. Their intelligence serves their judgment and forces them to often rethink their beliefs. It gives them extensive education and ease of expression.

                      <p class="z">Mercury in the 8th House</p><p>Mercury in the eighth house represents the house of sharing resources. These people are great researchers and they like to find out how things work. They like to think about life. They are often interested in financial matters - insurance policies or financial resources that belong to other people. Their interest in human behaviour and human reactions are the reason why they often study related fields.

                      <p class="t">Venus in Virgo <img src="https://www.astro-seek.com/seek-images/seek-icons/horoskop-panna.gif"/></p>Venus in Virgo can signal difficulties because love and beauty cannot coexist with analysis, so one of them must be suppressed. The result of analysing love and art is the realisation that one must accept secrets and stop analysing them. These people have a very gentle and rare sense of distinction. If people with Venus in Virgo decide to prefer inspiration over technology, they can become unbeatable in appreciating, expressing and maintaining the wonderful fragility of love and beauty. They gain their refined taste for social, emotional and artistic values during their systematic routine of searching for defects and removing them. As far as love and relationships are concerned, they undergo a process of purification, which removes unclean thoughts, feelings, and values. Because of this, they can become temporarily or permanently old bachelors or spinsters.

                      <p class="z">Venus in the 7th house</p><p>Venus in the seventh house suggests social people and usually also happy marriage. Most personal relationships will be harmonious and friendly. Marriage and friends play an important role in the lives of these people and they greatly contribute to their success. Marriage usually brings wealth. This position is favourable for jobs that require dealing with public, such as psychology, sales, advertising, and so on.

                    <p class="t">Mars in Libra <img src="https://www.astro-seek.com/seek-images/seek-icons/horoskop-vahy.gif"/></p>People with Mars in Libra are not very social. They find it hard to make a decisive move or statement without prior permission or consent of other people. They try to get what they want and synchronise it with social values and emotional demands of other people. They need to be more assertive and independent. Until they will be able to unify their needs and values with their wishes they will probably be dominated by someone with whom they want to have a sexual relationship. They attract aggressive, energetic and irritable partners.

                    <p class="z">Mars in the 8th House</p><p>Mars in the eighth house suggests a person who has a talent for searching information in more or less in any field. They can be scientists, researchers, or detectives. They often have the prerequisites to work in the fields of medicine, law and finance. They can also solve problems in various other fields. They are experts who are able to find solutions that require research. They need love in their life and they have a strong sexual urge. Mars in the eighth house also suggests contradictory attitudes towards common or collective property or heritage.

                    <p class="t">Jupiter in Scorpio <img src="https://www.astro-seek.com/seek-images/seek-icons/horoskop-stir.gif"/></p>People with Jupiter in Scorpio have a life philosophy of "no profit without hardship" which leads to a powerful desire for depth, darkness, and mystery. They dislike superficial happiness and their precious feelings are hidden in their dark side. They are willing to go through difficult situations to access these feelings and may find opportunities for sexual experiences during their search for depth and catharsis.

                    <p class="z">Jupiter in the 9th House</p>
                    Jupiter in the ninth house suggests important interests such as philosophy, religion, and higher education. These people seek education and they are talented higher education teachers. They are probably going to travel a lot, which will benefit them.</p>
